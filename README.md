# boat-skills

This project provides rating estimation models for boat race players using probabilistic skill evaluation methods like OpenSkill and TrueSkill.

## ðŸŒŠ What's this?

This repository aims to:
- Provide a simple and reproducible skill-rating system for boat racers
- Demonstrate reproducible machine learning with open source tools
- Serve as a stepping stone toward more advanced deep learning models in the future

## ðŸš§ Status

This is an early stage project. Currently, it focuses on:
- Implementing skill rating models using `openskill` and `trueskill`
- Providing utility scripts and Jupyter notebooks for experiments and evaluation
- Releasing rating results as open data for further use

## ðŸ”® Future Plans

- Deep learning models using PyTorch / TensorFlow (internal)
- Probabilistic modeling using Pyro
- Betting simulation system (closed-source for now)
- Potential commercial usage for detailed reports

## ðŸ“‚ Structure


## ðŸ§  Notes

This repository is also a personal project to:
- Learn and document skill modeling techniques
- Explore reproducibility and public transparency in model building
- Serve as an OSS portfolio for machine learning engineering

> Note: Some parts of this project (e.g. betting pipeline and DL models) are intentionally not included at this stage. This repository focuses on reproducible and educational components only.

The author is also exploring more advanced modeling internally.
